Modal overwrites SVG patterns - fix!!

Make page nav hidden by default, if height less than my screen 
Why does opening modal replace all icons with last pattern-fill???


Food Flow:		
No zero handling in the timeline plot
timeline labels wrong!

Country Explorer
add slider labels for years
add bar charts (need to pass entire country array, not just country-year)
rank bars - allow selection of two country bars in different colors
add highlight bars behind selected data (in case bars are too small to see)
re-size brush selection when reshuffle function updates graph (currently loses scale connection b/c array doesn't get re-trimmed)
hide/remove dropdowns in ranking view
restrict degrading data to 2003
try changing slider "oninput" to "onchange" to reduce function calls? (Label updates probably still want to be oninput)
add urban land and pop 2050 to visualizations?
add alphabetical x-axis labels 
Land degradation/area ranking should be in percent rather than total land area? (or add additional selector)
sort decr value not maintained on year update with slider
switch between rank and sbs not clearing out sidebar yet? <br> before re-appends on re-enter rank section
problem with multiple function calls when switching between sbs and compare rank (seems worse after leaving alone for a few mins??)
problem with scaling in sbs mode - land area at least, possibly others?
brushing broken in ranking after multiple interactions (solved on refresh)
not removing sidebar labels/lind breaks w/ multiple switches between sbs and ranking view
Rank --> overview --> compare goes to rank, not sbs!

need degraded land calc'd for regions and world
Monaco crowding 16480??
several countries with 0 people/sq km, eg: Macao, Mayotte, Monaco

Soil Degradation:
add pie chart to show % degradation classes? 

Ecoregions:
SVG needs to become responsive
Map mismatch on window size change
Try implementing map mesh to speed drawing?
redo biome definitions mapping

Soil organisms:
Make responsive

World pop
resize on page change
distinguish between prediction, reconstructed data, and World Bank data paths
tooltip reposition on brushing, disappear when mouse leaves plot

SoilMap
resize problems on FF getting bigger only
