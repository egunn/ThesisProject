On land, soil is second only to coal, oil, and gas reserves in the amount of carbon it stores, making it an important way to help reduce climate change. The soil stores a little over 4 times more carbon than is used by all life on earth, including plants. (Values are given in trillions of kg of carbon dioxide, and percent of total.) <br> <br>Of the carbon stored in soil, most is found in the form of soil organic carbon, or humus. This is the material that feeds soil organisms, like earthworms, bacteria and fungi.", "link":"index.html", "linkText":"Index"},
