On land, soil is second only to coal, oil, and gas reserves in the amount of carbon it stores, making it an important way to help reduce climate change. The soil stores a little over 4 times more carbon than is used by all life on earth, including plants. (Values are given in trillions of kg of carbon dioxide, and percent of total.) <br> <br>Of the carbon stored in soil, most is found in the form of soil organic carbon, or humus.
